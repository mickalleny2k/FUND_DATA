# FUNDAMENTALS of DATA ANALYTICS

# PROJECT and Tasks by Michael Allen
## INTRODUCTION
The repository contains two sections:
- Tasks
- Project on Fisher's Iris data set.
Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936, as an example of linear discriminant analysis i.e. a method used in statistics to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events. In this study, Fisher wished to investigate if the species of an Iris flower could be identified by examining its petal and sepal length and width.

## PURPOSE
 • The purpose of the project is to create a notebook investigating the variables and
data points within the well-known iris flower data set associated
with Ronald A Fisher.
- The purpose of the tasks section is to perform 5 tasks successfully.

## CONTENTS
### Contents of Tasks
All 5 tasks should be completed in a single notebook called tasks.ipynb.
The 5 tasks are as follows:
- Verify, using Python, that the conjecture is true for
the first 10,000 positive integers.
- Give an overview of the famous penguins data set explaining the types of variables it contains.
-  For each of the variables in the penguins data set 3 suggest what probability distribution from the numpy random distributions list is the most appropriate to model the variable.
-  Suppose you are flipping two coins, each with a probability p of giving heads. Plot the entropy of the total number of heads versus p.
-  Create an appropriate individual plot for each of the variables in the penguin data set.

### Contents of Project 
• In the project.ipynb notebook, I discuss the classification of each
variable within the data set according to common variable types
and scales of measurement in mathematics, statistics, and Python.
• Select, demonstrate, and explain the most appropriate summary
statistics to describe each variable.
• Select, demonstrate, and explain the most appropriate plot(s) for
each variable
• The notebook follows a cohesive narrative about the data
set

## ISSUES
### Troubleshooting cloning errors

https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/troubleshooting-cloning-errors

If you're having trouble cloning a repository, check these common errors.
1. HTTPS cloning errors
 - Check your Git version
 - Ensure the remote is correct
 - Provide an access token
 - Check your permissions
 - Use SSH instead
 
 2. Error: Repository not found
  - Check your spelling
  - Checking your permissions
  - Check your SSH access
  - Check that the repository really exists
  
 3. Error: Remote HEAD refers to nonexistent ref, unable to checkout
