# FUNDAMENTALS of DATA ANALYTICS

# PROJECT by Michael Allen
## INTRODUCTION
Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936, as an example of linear discriminant analysis i.e. a method used in statistics to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events. In this study, Fisher wished to investigate if the species of an Iris flower could be identified by examining its petal and sepal length and width.

## PURPOSE
 • The project is to create a notebook investigating the variables and
data points within the well-known iris flower data set associated
with Ronald A Fisher.

## CONTENTS
• In the notebook, I discuss the classification of each
variable within the data set according to common variable types
and scales of measurement in mathematics, statistics, and Python.
• Select, demonstrate, and explain the most appropriate summary
statistics to describe each variable.
• Select, demonstrate, and explain the most appropriate plot(s) for
each variable
• The notebook follows a cohesive narrative about the data
set

## ISSUES
### Troubleshooting cloning errors

https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/troubleshooting-cloning-errors

If you're having trouble cloning a repository, check these common errors.
1. HTTPS cloning errors
 - Check your Git version
 - Ensure the remote is correct
 - Provide an access token
 - Check your permissions
 - Use SSH instead
 
 2. Error: Repository not found
  - Check your spelling
  - Checking your permissions
  - Check your SSH access
  - Check that the repository really exists
  
 3. Error: Remote HEAD refers to nonexistent ref, unable to checkout
